# PrimeVideo-DataBinding-Android
android project developed with dataBinding 



this is local project work with specific server and if you want to use this source,you should know that`s not completed.

All the web service work with protocol buffer implemented with okHttp3 

i used android DatBinding native.and you can use this code as sample of DataBinding.

i developed exoplayer with overView layout for video player.

Good Luck
